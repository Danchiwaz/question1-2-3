##### - This sets an alarm and bring about the issuee of encrypting data

##### Have worked with several encryption/hashing algorithms and probably the most common.Kindly allow me to take you through
# Types of Encryption/Hashing method and their Implementation
1. Hash algorithm:
###### This algorithm is use to check or to validate intergrity/collectness of a message.**Hash** function in python is used to achieve the goal and helps in implemeting the solution.It generates fixed length output for different length input messages. The common algorithms are **MD5, Sha, HMAC ** and so on.
